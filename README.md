# Simple Capped Token Sale Review

---

This report is an ongoing effort of the ConsenSys Diligence team. It is maintained to keep up with the updates to the codebase.

This not only ensures that the reviews have the most amount of manual analysis possible but also keep up-to-date on the latest attack vectors and tooling upgrades.

Each major section which follows [SemVer notation](http://semver.org) corresponds to a certain pre-release of the codebase. **Only pre-releases are subject of reviews** and an actual release of the codebase means it is production-ready code.

The labels in the versioning of the codebase follow the format `ac.X`, where `ac` means _audit candidate_ and `X` represents the number of times that specific version of the codebase has been submitted (or re-submitted) for review. 

Release versions are consentual among developers and auditors.

The whole compilation of audits ordered chronologically can be found [**in this markdown file**](/blob/master/capped-token-sale_report.md).
