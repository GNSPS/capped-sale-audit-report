The codebase is comprised of two contracts: _Sale.sol_  and _Disbursement.sol_.


The first, _Sale.sol_ is the actual crowdsale contract. It runs as a single instance (gets deployed only once) and holds all the operational rules and parameters of the sale.

_Disbursement.sol_ on the other side is the contract ruling the vesting of offered tokens (to keep the right incentives in place and trustlessness alive). This one gets deployed multiple times (as much as the vestee number).

There is also an EthPM package being used which is an [ERC20, EIP610-compliant token from ConsenSys](https://github.com/ConsenSys/Tokens), these contracts are **outside** the scope of this review.
