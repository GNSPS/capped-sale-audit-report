The constructor function of the Disbursement.sol contract does not guarantee that the `owner` is not equal to `receiver` which would in turn let the vestee completely bypass the vesting schedule completely defeating the purpose of the timelock.

**Recommendation**

Change the initial conditions check in the constructor, adding:

`_receiver == msg.sender`

to [L54](https://github.com/GNSPS/simple-token-sale/blob/master/contracts/Disbursement.sol#L54) of the contract, turning the conditional check into:

`if (_receiver == 0 || _disbursementPeriod == 0 || _receiver == msg.sender)`
