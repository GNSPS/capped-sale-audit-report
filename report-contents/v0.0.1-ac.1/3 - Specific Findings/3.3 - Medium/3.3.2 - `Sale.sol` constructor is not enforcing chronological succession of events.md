The constructor function of the _Sale.sol_ contract does not guarantee that the end block effectively comes after the start block which in turn should always come before the freeze block.

**Recommendation**

Enforce chronological succession for the block state variables in the contract's constructor (`freezeBlock < startBlock && startBlock < endBlock`).
