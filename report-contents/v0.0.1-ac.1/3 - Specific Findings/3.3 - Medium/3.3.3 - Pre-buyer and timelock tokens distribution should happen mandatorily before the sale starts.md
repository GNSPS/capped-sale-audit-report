The disbursement of both the pre-buyers and timelocked vesting contracts should forcibly happen before the public sale starts or even better, before the freeze period.

**Recommendation**

Apply the `notFrozen()` modifier to the `distributePreBuyersRewards()` and the `distributeTimelockedTokens()` functions.
