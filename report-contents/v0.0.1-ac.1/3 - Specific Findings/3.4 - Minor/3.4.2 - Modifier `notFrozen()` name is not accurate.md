The modifier name is not exactly representative of the conditions it enforces.

Like the `saleEnded()` and `saleNotEnded()` modifiers this one also doesn't have a name that is representative of the conditions it actually enforces. However it's design is well implemented in the several functions that use it so only a name change is in order.

Naming in a general use codebase like this is important for in future upgrades and changes a different developer might mistake this modifier's behaviour and introduce a new security hole inadvertently.

**Recommendation**

Change `notFrozen` to `beforeFreeze`.
