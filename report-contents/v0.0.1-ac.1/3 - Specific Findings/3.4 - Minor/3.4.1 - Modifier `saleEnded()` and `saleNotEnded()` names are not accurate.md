The modifiers' names are not exactly representative of the conditions they enforce.

Their only checks are related to the end block, but the sale might end sooner by selling all the tokens before the end block.

The function `withdrawRemainder()` implements the `saleEnded()` modifier correctly (since there would be no remainder if the sale ended sooner).
The `purchaseTokens()` tokens function, on the other hand, does implement the `saleNotEnded()` modifier hence letting people still send requests even after there are no more tokens to sell.

**Recommendation**

Change `saleEnded` to `afterEndBlock`.

Add another check to `saleNotEnded()` making sure the sale contract's token balance is bigger than 0.
