In the `distributeTimelockedTokens()` function of the `Sale.sol` contract a check should exist to make sure that the `owner` account is not also a vestee in one of the disbursement contracts deployed.

**Recommendation**

Add a requirement to each iteration of the function's `for` loop:

`require(owner != beneficiary);`
